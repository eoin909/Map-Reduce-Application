Some quotes from famous personalities across the world on the 

Bhagavad-Gita: 



Albert Einstein 

"When I read the Bhagavad-Gita and reflect about how God created this 
universe everything else seems so superfluous." 

Aldous Huxley 

"The Bhagavad-Gita is the most systematic statement of spiritual 
evolution of endowing value to mankind. It is one of the most clear and 
comprehensive summaries of perennial philosophy ever revealed; hence 
its enduring value is subject not only to India but to all of humanity." 

Mahatma Gandhi 

"When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and I 
see not one ray of hope on the horizon, I turn to Bhagavad-Gita and find a 
verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of 
overwhelming sorrow. Those who meditate on the Gita will derive fresh 
joy and new meanings from it every day." 

Henry David Thoreau 

"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal 
philosophy of the Bhagavad-Gita, in comparison with which our modern 
world and its literature seem puny and trivial. " 

Dr. Albert Schweitzer 

"The Bhagavad-Gita has a profound influence on the spirit of mankind by 
its devotion to God which is manifested by actions." 

Carl Jung 

"The idea that man is like unto an inverted tree seems to have been 
current in by gone ages. The link with Vedic conceptions is provided by 
Plato in his Timaeus in which it states 'behold we are not an earthly but a 
heavenly plant.' This correlation can be discerned by what Krishna 
expresses in chapter 15 of Bhagavad-Gita." 

Herman Hesse 

"The marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of life's 
wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion." 

Ralph Waldo Emerson 

"I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-Gita. It was the first of books; 
it was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, 
serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age 
and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which 
exercise us."

SRIMAD BHAGAVAD-GITA 

In English 
Introduction 

The Bhagavad-Gita is one of the most noblest and read scriptures of India, even 
one of the deepest sacred scriptures of the world, really meant for all ages, even 
more in this time and age, as it is a "psychology of the consciousness" in its 
threefold phase. The dialogue of eighteen discourses {chapters), 700 verses 
altogether, is a written contribution to the transformation of the embodied soul, 
the whole man, or as the Bible puts it in "Genesis" the "man, the living soul". 
The Bhagavad-Gita represents the soul-knowledge, the heart-love, the mind- 
knowledge, the vital-dynamism and the body action. 

According to the Psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, consciousness, seemingly the 
sine qua non of humanity is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath consciousness 
lies a much larger substratum of forgotten or repressed personal memories, 
feelings, and behaviours, which Jung termed the personal unconscious. And 
beneath that lies the deep sea of the collective unconscious, huge and ancient, 
filled with all the images and behaviours that have been repeated over and over 
throughout history of not only the world, but life itself. Jung was a scientist who 
believed in objective evidence. However, he felt strongly that the attempt to 
make psychology a statistical science was misguided. For him, a growth in 
consciousness is always a heroic effort by the individual, straining against the 
yoke of what everyone else assumes that they already know. Any growth in 
mass consciousness comes about through the effort of many such individuals. 
Consciousness develops in spurts, both in the individual and in the species. In 
the species, as long as our current level of understanding seems adequate to the 
problems at hand, little change occurs. But when new circumstances emerge, 
consciousness takes a jump. The collective unconscious contains information 
that can be accessed by anyone at any time. It appears to have no limits in time 
and space. That is, it can access information that was recorded by primitive 
people, or it can access information about events that have not yet taken place in 
your life. Consciousness, only a tiny part of the psyche, is not a recent scientific 
development as you may think, it is as old as the world, brought forward in the 
Vedas, and above all in the Bhagavad-Gita. Beneath it lays the personal 
unconscious and below that lays the vast expanse of the collective unconscious. 
All sensory experience is first filtered through the collective unconscious - 
archetypes {patterns, components) - which gather our life experiences that make 
up a complex to find the archetype within, like peeling away the layers of an 
onion. Archetypes are "components" of knowledge, "sources" of knowledge, 



and heavily involved with the "development" and "deployment" of our 
knowledge of reality. 

Long before Jung, the Gita associated all the above, that man has first to acquire 
the proper buddhi - perception and understanding - which makes him see the 
situation he faces in its proper perspective. The Gita emphasises this and the 
ways in which this can be achieved, but the sequence and the ways suggested 
may seem confusing and repetitive to the neophyte. Even Arjuna has to seek 
explanation and clarification several times all over the eighteen chapters. 
Krishna's long discourse is not merely a theoretical/metaphysical/psychological 
exposition, but goes beyond that and is even prescriptive. Three distinct 
disciplines are indicated, but it is important to note that these are far from being 
mutually exclusive and are in many respects complementary to one another. The 
three disciplines are: Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga. We all have 
some idea of what the term yoga means, a kind of intense discipline which 
enables one to control and strengthen the psychic potential which is ours. 

Jnana Yoga is the Yoga of Devotion to knowledge taught in the second and third 
discourse, accompanied with renunciation and reached by means of Karma 
Yoga, this Yoga in which the Vedic teaching regarding the life of activity and 
retirement (Pravrtti, the act of enjoying material and sensual pleasures, the 
natural tendency of human beings and Nivrtti, the act of abstaining from 
material and sensual enjoyment) is understood. It is this Yoga which forms the 
subject of the Supreme Lord's teaching throughout the Gita. Thinking, therefore, 
that the Vedic Teaching has been concluded, He extols it by relating its lineage. 

Bhakti Yoga as found in the twelfth discourse, Arjuna is supposed to have 
addressed the Supreme Lord in this way: In the discourses beginning with the 
second and ending with the tenth which treats of Divine Manifestations 
{Glories), You have taught the worship of the Supreme Self, the Imperishable 
(Akshara) Brahman, devoid of all conditions (upadhis): and You have also 
taught here and there the worship of Yourself as the Supreme Lord of the 
Universe, associated with the condition (upadhi) of that energy (sattva) which 
has the power of carrying on all evolutionary process and of knowing 
everything. And in the (eleventh) Discourse treating of the Universal From, 
Your Primal Form as Isvara manifesting itself as the whole universe has also 
been shown by You for the same purpose of worship. And having shown that 
Form, You have exhorted me to do works for Your sake only (Gita 11.55), and 
so on. Therefore, I ask of You with a desire to know which of these two ways is 
the better. Resumed: Bhakti Yoga is simply communicating with the Supreme 
Lord through devotional service. 



Karma Yoga is the path of God realisation through dedicating the fruits of one's 
work to the Supreme Lord. The two aspects of knowledge relating respectively 
to Pravrtti and Nivrtti, i.e., to the Path of Actions and the Path of Renunciation, 
with which the Gita-Sastra is concerned have been pointed out by the Supreme 
Lord in the Second Discourse. He has recommended renunciation of action to 
those who hold on the Sankhya-buddhi (Sankhya aspect of knowledge) and has 
added in Gita 2.72 that their end can be achieved by being devoted to that alone. 
And as to Arjuna, He has declared in Gita 2.47 that he should resort to actions 
(karma) alone as based on Yoga-buddhi (the Yoga aspect of knowledge), while it 
has not been said that the Highest Good can be attained by that alone. 

The Bhagavad-Gita is rich, and psychological, beautiful, full of poetic power. 
The characters stand out in heroic grandeur, in the midst of a magnificent setting 
of martial valour. The figures of Arjuna, very human in despondency and doubt, 
and of Krishna, majestic, resolute, persuasive, are clear, living, of universal, and 
truth of all religions. On the other side, the Gita is full inspiration, of religious 
devotion, and of keenest insight into the heart of man. The conflict of motives 
that overwhelmed human action, the clinging of fetters of selfishness which 
check us in the path to the immortal, the slight evasions of the lurking whisperer 
in the heart of man: all are clearly seen and clearly revealed. Yet, as a whole, the 
claims of abstract thought are not forgotten; every stage of Indian philosophy, 
every shade of logic, metaphysics and psychology, is given its place; and many 
practical suggestions are put forward, touching the problems of Indian politics 
and history, hints as valid today also in our Western world of human affairs as 
they were three thousand years ago.
